# Nashville Software School Front-End Capstone Project: storytime

Storytime is an interactive application currently aimed at children which builds a story as the user selects an image from different groups of images. The resulting story may then be read aloud and, if the user is logged in, saved to their "bookshelf." The application was built with AngularJS, Javascript, Firebase and ResponsiveVoiceJS and showcases mobile-frst design.
